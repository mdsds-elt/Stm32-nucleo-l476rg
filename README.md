### Stm32-nucleoL476rg with the ultrasonic sensor:

### Components:

- [ ] Stm32-nucleoL476r;
- [ ] Display oLED 0.96;
- [ ] Sensor Hc-sr04;
- [ ] LEds(Red and Green);
- [ ] Resistor.

The sensor sends a signal proportional to the measured distance, after reflecting on any obstacle the signal returns to the SENSOR.
When an obstacle approaches the sensor, an audible signal is emitted through a Buzzer, the project also consists of a red LED to indicate the approach and a green LED to indicate the distance from the obstacle.
